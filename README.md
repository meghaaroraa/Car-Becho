The dataset used for the project can be accessed at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho

The project is deployed using streamlit library.

## Methodology Used:
1. Data analysis
2. Data cleaning
3. Handling features
4. Converting categorical values in numerical values
5. Model training and evaluation
6. Model Testing and validation

## Random Forest Algorithm
Random Forest is a powerful machine learning algorithm that utilizes the collective wisdom of multiple decision trees to make accurate predictions. By aggregating the predictions of numerous individual trees and averaging them out, Random Forest reduces overfitting and increases prediction accuracy across a wide range of tasks, making it a popular choice for classification and regression problems.
